# Archived Test Files

This directory contains legacy test files from the development process. These files test older implementations and are kept for historical reference.

## Contents

- `test-current-puzzle.js` - Old puzzle state tests
- `test-matrix-integration.js` - Integration tests for old matrix solver
- `test-matrix-solver.js` - Tests for original matrix implementation
- `test-simple-matrix.js` - Simple matrix operation tests
- `test-simple-solver.js` - Old simple solver tests
- `test-solver-simple.js` - Legacy BFS solver tests
- `test-solver-verification.js` - Verification of old solvers
- `verify-solver.js` - Old solver verification script

## Status

These files are **archived** and likely outdated. The current implementation uses the math.js matrix solver tested in `pentagon-webapp/tests/`.

Consider removing these files if they are no longer needed for reference.
