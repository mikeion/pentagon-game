## How It Works

The game features a pentagon where each vertex contains a complex number (in the form `a+bi`). Players can apply one of four different "moves" to transform these numbers and try to match a target configuration.

### The Four Move Types

Each move affects the clicked vertex and its two adjacent neighbors:

- **Move A**: Adds `1+i` to clicked vertex, adds `-1-i` to neighbors
- **Move B**: Adds `-1+i` to clicked vertex, adds `-i` to neighbors  
- **Move C**: Adds `1-i` to clicked vertex, adds `1` to neighbors
- **Move D**: Adds `1-i` to clicked vertex, adds `i` to neighbors

### Controls

- **Left-click** a vertex to apply the selected move (add)
- **Right-click** or **long-press** a vertex to subtract the move
- **Select move types** A, B, C, or D using the buttons
- Click **"Show Guide"** for detailed instructions

### Mathematical Background

This game is based on Dr. Alex McDonough's research (see `/docs`) into group theory and complex number operations. The four moves generate a group action on the space of complex number configurations on a pentagon. Remarkably, there are exactly **162 unique orbital configurations** possible - meaning only 162 distinct states can be reached from any starting position through these moves.

Key insights:
- Move A and Move C are inverses (they cancel each other)
- Move B and Move D are inverses (they cancel each other)
- Each vertex is connected to its two adjacent neighbors in the pentagon
